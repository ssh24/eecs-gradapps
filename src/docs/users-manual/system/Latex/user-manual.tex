\section{General Information}
This section explains in general terms the system and the purpose for which it is
intended.

\subsection{System Overview}

GradApps 2.0 is a business system application, which allows, our client to \emph{automate} the selection of the best candidate into the EECS Graduate Program by \emph{minimizing} the manual work to be done. Our client are the members of \textbf{The EECS Graduate Program}.

\bigskip
\noindent The application is broken down into three user levels: \emph{Administrator}, \emph{Committee Member} and \emph{Professor}. Each of the roles play a crucial part in order to select the best candidate into the graduate program. GradApps 2.0 operates as a web application, hence, a reliable internet connection is required when interacting with the application.

\subsection{Organization of the Manual}
The user’s manual consists of eight sections:

\begin{itemize}
\item \textbf{General Information} section explains in general terms the system and the purpose for which it is
intended.
\item \textbf{System Summary} section provides a general overview of the system. The summary outlines the uses of
the system’s hardware and software requirements, system’s configuration, user access levels and
system’s behavior in case of any contingencies.
\item \textbf{Getting Started} section explains how to get GradApps 2.0 and install to have it up and running. This section is solely for administrative uses.
\item \textbf{Using The System} section provides a detailed description of the common system functions.
\item \textbf{Administrator Use} section provides a detailed description of the administrator system functions.
\item \textbf{Committee Member Use} section provides a detailed description of the committee member system functions.
\item \textbf{Professor Use} section provides a detailed description of the professor system functions.
\item \textbf{Help} section provides the contact information for further help on using the application.
\end{itemize}

\section{System Summary}
This section provides a general overview of the system. The summary outlines the uses of
the system's hardware and software requirements, system’s configuration, user access levels and
system’s behavior in case of any contingencies.

\subsection{System Configuration} \label{system_conf}

\subsubsection{Browser Configuration}
GradApps 2.0 operates as a web interface application. It supports all modern web browser, however, Chrome and Mozilla Firefox are the recommended browser for using the application. The application is recommended to be only used through desktop browsers.

\bigskip
\noindent\textbf{Recommended Browser(s):}

\begin{itemize}
\item \textbf{Chrome}: $>=$ Chrome v60.0.3112
\item \textbf{Mozilla Firefox}: $>=$ Firefox 57 (v57.0a1)
\end{itemize}

\subsubsection{Node.js Configuration}
GradApps 2.0 is built using Node.js and it is vital to use the correct version of the node package manager (npm) and the node.

\bigskip
\noindent\textbf{Recommended Node.js version:}

\begin{itemize}
\item \textbf{Node}: $>=$ v8.9.4
\item \textbf{NPM}: $>=$ 5.6.0
\end{itemize}

\subsubsection{MySQL Configuration}
GradApps 2.0 uses MySQL commercial database as the datasource manager.

\bigskip
\noindent \textbf{Recommended MySQL version:} $>=$ 5.7.20

\bigskip
\noindent The following environmental variables are required to be set prior to starting the application.

\begin{itemize}
\item \textbf{MYSQL\_HOST}: the host name of the database server
\item \textbf{MYSQL\_PORT}: the port number of the database server
\item \textbf{MYSQL\_USER}: the user name to access the database
\item \textbf{MYSQL\_PASSWORD}: the password to access the database
\item \textbf{MYSQL\_DATABASE}: the database name (optional)
\end{itemize}

\bigskip
\noindent \textbf{Note:} The default database name for the application is \emph{gradapps}. However, any customized database name can be set by using the environmental variable mentioned above.

\subsubsection{Other Configuration}
The default port for the application web server is 3000. However, it can be set to one of your choice by enabling the PORT environmental variable.

\subsection{User Access Levels}
Only registered users can use the application. The user access levels for the three different user roles are discussed further in the document for each role.

\subsection{Contingencies}
In case of power outage or unexpected shutdown of the web server, the application will stop working and any unsaved data will be lost. It is recommended for users to save data frequently to avoid such losses.

\newpage
\section{Getting Started}
This section explains how to get GradApps 2.0 on the machine, install it and start the application. Please note this section is solely for the system administrator's who will maintain the application.

\bigskip
\noindent To install the application, it has to be pulled from the private GitHub repository as it is not a published application for other uses.

\bigskip
\noindent To clone the repository in the server machine, please make sure Git is installed in the machine. Along with Git, all the above configuration mentioned in Section \ref{system_conf} must be installed.

\bigskip
\noindent \textbf{Recommended Git version:} $>=$ 2.3.2

\smallskip
\begin{enumerate}
\item Git clone the repository in the current working directory, run the following command:
\begin{lstlisting}[language=bash]
  $ git clone https://github.com/ssh24/EECS4090-Project.git
\end{lstlisting}
\item Change the working directory to the source of the project:
\begin{lstlisting}[language=bash]
  $ cd EECS4090-Project/src/
\end{lstlisting}
\item Install the required dependencies:
\begin{lstlisting}[language=bash]
  $ npm install
\end{lstlisting}
\item Set the required environmental variables:
\begin{lstlisting}[language=bash]
  $ SET MYSQL_HOST = <host>
  $ SET MYSQL_PORT = <port>
  $ SET MYSQL_USERNAME = <username>
  $ SET MYSQL_PASSWORD = <password>
  $ SET MYSQL_DATABASE = <database>
  $ SET PORT = <app_port>
\end{lstlisting}
\item Seed the database:
\begin{lstlisting}[language=bash]
  $ npm run seed:app
\end{lstlisting}
\item Start the application server:
\begin{lstlisting}[language=bash]
  $ npm start
\end{lstlisting}
\item The application can then be accessed at port 3000 or the one set by you using the environmental variable. To access the application locally, go to \url{http://localhost:<app_port>}.
\end{enumerate}

\bigskip
\noindent \textbf{Note:} In order for the application be accessible from outside, the application port need to be set open. Once it is set open, the application can be accessed from anywhere it an internet in the following way: \url{http://<app_host>:<app_port>}.
