\end{center}
\caption{Filter View}
\label{fig:filter_view}
\end{figure}

\newpage
\subsection{Selecting Columns}

After opening the filter view, one can select one or more columns. Selecting a column numbers them in the order they will be displayed after the filter is applied. The following image depicts selecting four columns in order: \emph{Date Assigned, Degree Applied For, My Review Status and Actions}.

\bigskip
\noindent \textbf{Note}: When submitting a filter with no selected columns, all default columns will be used, i.e \emph{Date Assigned, Applicant Name, Degree Applied For, My Review Status and Actions}.

\begin{figure}[!htb]
\begin{center}
\includegraphics[width=.9\textwidth]{images/selected_col.png}
\end{center}
\caption{Selected Columns for Filter}
\label{fig:fm_selected_col}
\end{figure}

\subsection{Selecting Filter}

After opening the filter view, one can select one or more filters. Selecting a filter can be done only on \emph{Applicant Name}, \emph{Degree Applied For} and \emph{My Review Status} fields. Filtering can be done by selecting values using the selection dropdown which allows live-text searching. The following image depicts selecting a filter for \emph{Degree Applied For} where the Degree is equal to \emph{MSc}.

\bigskip
\noindent \textbf{Note}: When submitting a filter with no selected filters, the default table will be loaded.

\begin{figure}[!htb]
\begin{center}
\includegraphics[width=.9\textwidth]{images/selected_filter.png}
\end{center}
\caption{Selected Filter}
\label{fig:fm_selected_filter}
\end{figure}

\bigskip
\noindent Once the user selects a filter, the selected filter text shows the filter chosen. Grad Apps 2.0 only supports \textbf{AND} operand filtering. The image below depicts the selected filter text after selecting a filter for \emph{Degree Applied For} where the Degree is equal to \emph{MSc} and \emph{My Review Status} where review status is equal to \emph{Draft}.

\end{center}
\caption{Selected Filter Text}
\label{fig:fm_selected_filter_txt}
\end{figure}

\subsection{Filter Presets}
As an end user one can opt to save frequently used filters as presets that will be automatically loaded for the user's login session in that specified role. Saving a filter requires a preset name, the selected rows the user wants to see and the selected filter. 

\bigskip
\noindent The following image depicts on how to save a filter preset:
\begin{figure}[!htb]

\caption{Save a filter preset}
\label{fig:saving_preset}
\end{figure}

\newpage
\bigskip
\noindent Once the user has one or more saved presets, they can opt to load one by simply selecting the preset name from the dropdown. Loading a saved preset will automatically fill the selected columns and the selected filters. The following image depicts on how to load a saved filter preset:

\bigskip
\begin{figure}[!htb]

\end{center}
\caption{Load a saved filter preset}
\label{fig:load_preset}
\end{figure}

\clearpage
\newpage
\subsection{Submitting Filter}

Once the user has selected columns and selected filters, they can submit the filter to get a resulted table back.

\bigskip
\noindent \textbf{Note}: When submitting a filter with no selected columns, all default columns will be used, i.e \emph{Date Assigned, Applicant Name, Degree Applied For, My Review Status and Actions}.

\bigskip
\noindent \textbf{Note}: When submitting a filter with no selected filters, the default table will be loaded.

\bigskip
\noindent The following example filter is used to demonstrate applying a filter and getting the resulted table back:

\bigskip
\noindent \textbf{The columns selected for the filter}:
\begin{enumerate}
\item Date Assigned
\item Degree Applied For
\item My Review Status
\end{enumerate}

\noindent \textbf{The filter selected for}:
\begin{enumerate}
\item Degree Applied For: MSc
\end{enumerate}

\bigskip
\noindent The images below depicts the filter view before applying the filter and the resulting filtered table. The fields used for filtering are also highlighted for emphasizing the filtered fields in the resulting table.

\section{Reviews} \label{sec:reviews}
As a user one has access to complete application reviews assigned to them by the system administrator. The review process can have \textbf{three} different statuses shown to the user on the default portal:
\begin{itemize}
\item \textbf{New}: A new application has been assigned to the committee member and no changes have been made on the review yet.
\item \textbf{Draft}: A previously saved draft review. A review is considered as a draft when there has been at least one or more changes committed and the user has decided to save the changes.
\item \textbf{Submitted}: A completed review which has been submitted and uploaded to the server. Once a review is submitted, it cannot be undone.
\end{itemize}

\bigskip
\noindent The following list denotes the fields in a review form that is \textbf{not} submitted yet and their requirement status:
\begin{table}[h]

\end{tabular}
\caption {Review Fields Input Type}
\label{tbl:review_fields_input}
\end{table}

\subsubsection{Institution Assessment}
An end user can select one or more institutions the applicant has attended in the past. If the institution does not exist, the user can also add a new institution. Once an institution has been selected, the user can select one or more of the existing institution's assessment and also add a new assessment of their own.

\bigskip
\noindent The following image depicts an user selecting two institutions the applicant has attended and selecting an assessment from each of the institutions.

\newpage
\subsection{Saving a review as Draft}
As an end user one has the opportunity to save an on-going review as draft for future completion. The use of drafting a review is to save changes to an on-going review so that the user can pick it up and continue some time later.

\bigskip
\noindent The following images depicts a user making changes to an application review and then saving it as a draft. Consequently, the status of the review is changed to \textbf{Draft}. And if the user wants to continue working on the draft sometime later, the action for opening a drafted review will say \textbf{Continue Review}.
